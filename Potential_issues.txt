1. Remove Cars with Mileage Above 500,000
We'll remove rows where the Mileage is greater than 500,000, as you've observed that these are causing errors and their prices are irrelevant.

2. Limit the Year to 2000
We will filter the rows to keep only the cars with a Year greater than or equal to 2000, since cars older than this are irrelevant.

3. Handle Missing Mileage for New Cars
For cars with missing Mileage data:

If the Year is recent (within a certain threshold, e.g., 5 years), we'll keep the row with the null Mileage.
If the Year is older and Mileage is missing, we will remove the row.
4. Remove Cars with Irrelevant Price
We'll remove rows where the Price is below 8,000 or above 500,000 as these prices are considered outliers.
